  - You'll need it for your web site anyway, right?
- [Post some project ideas](https://github.com/bitsoc/seniorproject-2016/tree/master/ideas)
  - Put up your ideas and start conversations! Make issues and comments and changes. Make ideas better, or make better ideas!

### Turn projects into boss monsters in a [BITSoc guild on HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com/#/options/groups/guilds/8f986218-c1eb-4fe7-a4a7-07ea88fe5895)
