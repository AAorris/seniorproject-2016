- Personal Website: http://tegankilpatrick.ca (kind of broken right now, I'll fix it up when I'm not spending so much time on homework)

- I'm hoping to get into a senior project group where I can do a lot of 3D modelling and concept art to use as portfolio pieces. And I really like creating things from fantasy and sci-fi settings.

I don't know what else to write here...
