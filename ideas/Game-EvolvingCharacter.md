#Exploration Based Evolving Character Game
######Idea by Stephanie Lawrence and Tegan Kilpatrick

####Basics
- 3rd person exploration
- Player character starts out as a featureless humanoid being
- Character's appearance evolves based on player actions and evironments explored (other things? this isn't set in stone)
- Similarly, player skills are based on environments explored, so the character's appearance will reflect their abilities
- Basically, a stats screen is unecessary because looking at your character will tell you what kind of abilities they have and the strength of those abilities
- Players use magical abilities in combat

####Controls
- If anyone is interested in programming a MYO armband or similar gesture/motion based input device, that could be very interesting, especially for casting spells
- Otherwise controls would be standard gamepad controls

####Extra
- If you're interested in this project we would love to hear from you! It's very much in a conceptual phase, so we are very open to suggestions and willing to change things as the idea is refined
